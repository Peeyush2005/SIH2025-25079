                <h2>The problem: Broken conductors in LT distribution</h2>
                <div class="content-balanced">
                    <div class="rich-text">
                        <p>Low-tension (LT) distribution networks carry electricity from transformers to homes and businesses. When a conductor snaps‚Äîdue to aging, weather, mechanical stress, or animal contact‚Äîa dangerous condition called a <strong>broken conductor fault (BCF)</strong> occurs. Unlike a short circuit, where current spikes dramatically, a broken conductor creates an <strong>unbalanced three-phase system</strong>.</p>
                        <p>In this unbalanced state, one phase may be completely disconnected while the other two continue to deliver power. The result is abnormal voltages on the load side, which can damage sensitive equipment like motors, refrigerators, and electronics. Single-phase loads may experience overvoltage while three-phase motors run on only two phases, leading to overheating and mechanical failure.</p>
                        <p>Traditional overcurrent relays struggle with BCFs because the fault current may not be significantly higher than normal load current. This means the fault can persist undetected, creating safety hazards such as downed wires energized at lethal voltages, fire risks, and prolonged equipment damage.</p>

                <h2>Our solution: Sequence-based detection (ANSI 46BC)</h2>
                <div class="content-balanced">
                    <div class="rich-text">
                        <p>Our approach uses a well-established power-system concept called <strong>symmetrical components</strong>. Any set of three-phase currents can be decomposed into three balanced sets:</p>
                        <ul class="feature-list">
                            <li><strong>Positive sequence (I1):</strong> Represents normal, balanced operation (A-B-C rotation)</li>
                            <li><strong>Negative sequence (I2):</strong> Represents unbalance (A-C-B rotation)</li>
                            <li><strong>Zero sequence (I0):</strong> Represents ground faults (all phases in phase)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In a healthy three-phase system, the negative sequence (I2) is nearly zero. When a conductor breaks, I2 rises sharply because the system is no longer balanced. By monitoring the <strong>ratio I2/I1</strong>, we create a sensitive, load-independent indicator of broken conductor conditions.</p>
                        <p>The algorithm continuously measures the three phase currents (A, B, C), computes I1 and I2 using Fortescue's transformation, and compares the ratio to a configurable threshold (typically 15%). If the ratio exceeds the threshold and I1 is above a minimum load level, a timer starts. If the condition persists for the set time (typically 1 second), the relay issues a trip command to isolate the feeder.</p>

                        <li>
                            <h4>Measure phase currents</h4>
                            <p>Current transformers (CTs) on each phase (A, B, C) provide real-time current measurements. The protection device samples these at high frequency (typically 64 samples per cycle).</p>

                        <li>
                            <h4>Compute symmetrical components</h4>
                            <p>Using Fortescue's transformation, the three phase currents are decomposed into positive (I1), negative (I2), and zero (I0) sequence components. This mathematical operation uses complex numbers and the operator Œ±.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Security check: Minimum load</h4>
                            <p>The algorithm checks if I1 is above a minimum threshold (typically 8-10% of rated current). This prevents false trips when the feeder is lightly loaded or off.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Evaluate the I2/I1 ratio</h4>
                            <p>The ratio of negative to positive sequence is calculated. In healthy operation, this is typically less than 5%. In a broken conductor condition, it exceeds 15-25%.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Definite-time delay</h4>
                            <p>If the ratio exceeds the threshold, a timer starts. The condition must persist for the full delay period (typically 0.5-2 seconds) to confirm the fault and avoid transient-triggered trips.</p>

                        <h3>Technical requirements</h3>
                        <p>The solution requires three-phase current inputs from CTs on the monitored feeder. These CTs are standard equipment in most substations and on many pole-mounted devices. The algorithm runs on any device capable of real-time signal processing‚Äîmodern microrelays, RTUs, or edge computers.</p>
                        <p>Settings are straightforward: operators configure the I2/I1 threshold (typically 0.12-0.20), the time delay (0.5-2.0 seconds), and the minimum I1 level (5-10% of rated). These values are based on feeder characteristics and can be refined during commissioning.</p>
                        <h3>Deployment pathway</h3>
                        <p>A phased rollout begins with pilot installations on feeders with known conductor issues or high exposure. Data is collected for 3-6 months to validate settings and tune thresholds. Once proven, the scheme is expanded to additional feeders. Integration with SCADA allows centralized monitoring and event logging.</p>
                        <p>The software can be deployed via firmware updates to existing relays (if supported) or by installing dedicated protection modules. Training for operators and maintenance staff is minimal, as the concepts are well-understood in the industry.</p>
